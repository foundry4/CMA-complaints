            Technical information about this website’s accessibility
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            The Competition and Markets Authority is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to the non-compliances listed below.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">
            Non accessible content
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li><a href="/which_products">The product selection page</a></li>
        </ul>

   
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Non compliance with the accessibility regulations
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            The product selection page has multiple embedded controls, which does not currently comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The team will explore how to fix this issue with future iterations, and in the meantime alternatives to the digital form are available for users affected.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Disproportionate burden
        </h2>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
            Navigation and accessing information
        </h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a ‘skip to main content’ option). This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 2.4.1 (bypass blocks).
        </p>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
            Interactive tools and transactions
        </h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Our form is built and hosted through third party software and ‘skinned’ to look like our website. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.3.1 (information and relationships).

            How we tested this website
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            This website was last tested on 1 April 2020. The test was carried out by the Competition and Markets Authority and Not Binary.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            We tested a number of different response combinations, and used the WAVE accessibility tester, which showed no errors for the majority of the pages.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            There are some errors for more complicated pages, in particular the product selection page where there are multiple embedded controls.
